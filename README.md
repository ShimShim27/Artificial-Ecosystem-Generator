# Artificial-Ecosystem-Generator
This is my 3rd year project in Software Engineering.

## Description
  This system was built in Netbeans and is using JavaSwing for GUI.
  This software can simulate artificial ecosystem.
  It uses Machine Learning to do this , specifically RT-NEAT.
  When you run the simulation for a decent amount of time , you will see which species are dominant.
  You can also change parameters of the software in settings.


## Usage
-Import the project
-Install all the needed libraries especially JSwing.
-Rebuild and Clean the project
