# Artificial-Ecosystem-Generator
A program to simulate artificial ecosystem using machine learning. (The code contains a lot of comments and maybe messy because it is my previous school project)<br/><br/>

Download the direct jar file [here](https://github.com/ShimShim27/Artificial-Ecosystem-Generator-Using-RT-NEAT/blob/main/Ecosystem/Ecosystem.jar).

## Description
* This system was built in Netbeans and is using JavaSwing for GUI.
* This software can simulate artificial ecosystem.
* It uses Machine Learning to do this , specifically RT-NEAT.
* When you run the simulation for a decent amount of time , you will see which species are dominant.
* You can also change parameters of the software in settings.


## Running The Code
* Import the project in your chosen IDE.
* Install all the needed libraries especially JSwing.
* Rebuild and Clean the project.
* Run the project.
* IMPORTANT NOTE - If you are getting the producing a jar file , be sure that you don't do
"clean" action (example: 'clean project' or 'build and clean') because the images won't be included in the output jar. Instead , do "build" action before creating the jar.


## Usage
* When the program started , you will be greeted with initial screen. Click "Start Evolution".
* You will be redirected to the main window. Click "Start New" in the upper right corner. A simulation will start.
* To load/save/delete your simulation , click "Load/Save" in the upper right.
* If you want to change the settings , click "Settings".
* You can also view the neural network structure and physical traits of the organisms by clicking it.
